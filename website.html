    <p>Hello, I'm Ryan. I am a 14 year old boy in Homestead High school, California.</p>
    <h2>Arianna</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Arianna Reshadi. I am an 11 year old girl and I go to Stratford Sunnyvale De Anza school. I love cats and in fact we have two cats, Shadow and Cindy. 
        But more on them later. I enjoy drawing and am decent at it even though I have never gone to art class. I am an A+ student in school, getting good grades and being the
    teacher's pet.</p>
