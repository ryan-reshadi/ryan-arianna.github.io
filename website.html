    <h3>The Cats</h3>
    <!--todo: add images of the cats-->
    <p>We have two garden cats, Shadow and Cindy. Originially, we got them to rid our backyard of mice. But we came to love the two little furballs as proper cats, not just animals. 
    We got Shadow in August 2023 as a one year old female black cat. She was at first afraid of us, but she came to love us and view us as her family. We got 5 month year old Cindy 
    in January 2024. By then, Shadow was accustomed to us. However, Cindy was utterly terrified. She hissed and growled at us, ran away all the time, and would not eat or sleep while
    we were around. However, Cindy absolutely adored Shadow, rubbing her and meowing often to her. Shadow, on the other hand, was quite intolerant of the clingy cat and often hissed
    or pawed Cindy. Some time in April 2024, when our family was on a trip, our aunt, who had been occasionally checking on the cats, notified us that Shadow's right eye had gone 
    entirely brownish black. She was taken to the vet by my aunt and they said she had experienced some trama around her eye, causing bleeding, hence the odd color. She was given a 
    cone (to keep her from further hurting her eye) and one dose of antibiotics (by my aunt). We arrived home the next day and gave Shadow her second dose of antibiotics. She was 
    somber and appeared to be in pain. She was taken to the vet weekly. The vet said she was still young and her eye could heal. Else, her eye would have to be removed to prevent her
    brain from being damaged (Which was an extremely expensive opperation by the way. Besides, it felt sad). However we noticed she was worse every visit we had to the vet. We 
    decided to cease taking her there and see what happened. She began to get better and her eye cleared up. Although the injured eye was slightly discolored and the pupil was a 
    little bit bigger that the other, she seemed fine. We removed her cone and took her off antibiotics. She was ridiculously happy to be rid of the cone and weird liquid being 
    shoved in her mouth. Eventually, things returned to normal. Even a month later, the place we had stayed at during our trip always reminded me (Arianna) of uneasiness and 
    discomfort. Despite everything that had just happened, Cindy was the absolute same, always afraid of us. It was August 2024 when she'd even let us get near her.In October, Cindy
    becamce slightly more affectionate and was allowing us to come close and touch her. Shadow was the same, however: always adorable, food loving and super affectionate. Today our
    two cats are happy and healthy and we couldn't imagine life without them.</p>
