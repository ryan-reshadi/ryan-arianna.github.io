    <p id="Arianna-Paragraph">Hi, my name is Arianna Reshadi. I am an 11 year old girl and I go to Stratford Sunnyvale De Anza school. I love cats and in fact we have two cats, Shadow and Cindy. 
        But more on them later. I enjoy drawing and am decent at it even though I have never gone to art class. I am an A+ student in school, getting good grades and being the
    teacher's pet.</p>

    <p id="Aydin-Paragraph">Hi, I'm Aydin. I am a 14 year old boy and go to Mountain View High School in California. I like to code cool programs in Python, draw, read occasionally, and play video games.
        I also really like penguins. When I grow up, I either want to help design video games or help penguins out in the wild. Maybe I will find a way to do both.
